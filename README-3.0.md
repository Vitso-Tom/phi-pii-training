## üîí Verifying File Integrity

To verify you have an authentic copy:

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
Get-FileHash index.html -Algorithm SHA256
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
shasum -a 256 index.html
```

**Expected Hash (v3.1):**
```
93DB4B16B8254BCEAC401BE1E6951734131CC3A0D06E0E834CD2814CC6DB56AD
```

Compare the output to the hash in `PROVENANCE.md`.
