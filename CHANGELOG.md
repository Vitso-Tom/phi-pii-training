# Changelog - PHI/PII Identification & Handling Training

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## [v3.1] - October 21, 2025 (Current Version)
**Progress Saving & Session Management**

**Automatic Progress Saving**

Auto-save to browser localStorage on all user interactions
Saves on question answers, module navigation, and subsection clicks
Saves progress before page close/refresh
Visual "‚úì Progress Saved" toast notification
1-second delay to ensure actions complete before saving


**Welcome Back Resume Prompt**

"Welcome Back!" dialog when returning with saved progress
Displays last session date/time
Shows current module and total modules
Shows current subsection name for Module 3 & 4
Displays number of questions answered
"Continue Training" and "Start Fresh" options


**State Preservation**

Complete answer history with correct/incorrect status
Module completion tracking
Module 3 subsection progress (all 6 subsections)
Module 4 subsection progress (all 4 subsections)
User name for certificate
Current subsection tracking for multi-subsection modules


**User Experience Improvements**

Resume exactly where user left off
No data loss on browser close/refresh
Clear visual feedback when progress saves
Graceful handling of localStorage errors
Works across browser sessions (same browser/device)


**Technical Implementation**

Integration with existing state management system
localStorage-based persistence (no backend required)
Subsection name capture on button click for accurate tracking
JSON serialization of complete training state
Error handling with try-catch blocks
Browser compatibility (all modern browsers)


**Limitations & Considerations**

Progress stored locally per browser (doesn't sync across devices)
Requires localStorage support (not available in private/incognito mode)
Progress cleared if user clears browser data
Not compatible with cross-browser usage




## [v3.0] - October 19, 2025
**Major Content Enhancements**
**Module 3 Complete Rewrite - "When Safe Data Becomes PHI"**

Expanded from simple scenarios to 6 comprehensive subsections with advanced technical content
Added 20+ minutes of expert-level training content
New subsections:

Basic Context Rules (foundation)
Database Design & API Patterns (architectural decisions)
Logging & Analytics Traps (observability pitfalls)
The Inference Problem (behavioral patterns)
Multi-System Data Flows (integration points)
HIPAA Safe Harbor (technical implementation)



**Module 3 Subsection Details:**

Database & API Patterns: Schema design anti-patterns, table join implications, API response design, GraphQL query risks, code examples with PostgreSQL/MySQL patterns
Logging & Analytics: Error logs capturing PHI, stack traces, analytics events, monitoring tools (Datadog/CloudWatch/Azure Monitor), safe logging patterns with hashed IDs
Inference Problem: Behavioral patterns implying health conditions, app usage timing, location + health app correlation, technical solutions (differential privacy, k-anonymity, aggregation thresholds)
Multi-System Flows: CRM + EHR integration, marketing + health programs, support ticket PHI creation, time window effects, session correlation risks
Safe Harbor Implementation: Technical database views, automated redaction, ZIP code population lookups, practical code examples

**Module 4 Core Principles Expansion**

Expanded "Core Principles" subsection with three foundational principles:

Minimize Access & Storage - Default deny, scope reduction, practical examples
Use Approved Tools Only - BAA requirements, tool vetting process, common violations
De-identify for Development - Synthetic data, transformation techniques, testing strategies


Added "What this means in practice" sections for each principle
Included common violation examples with real-world scenarios
Added "Why this matters" explanations connecting to actual incidents

**UI/UX Improvements**

Fixed subsection visibility logic with explicit style.display management
Added comprehensive JavaScript debugging for subsection navigation
Enhanced CSS class and inline style coordination

Code examples using real database patterns and API designs
Practical guidance for AWS, GCP, Azure environments
Enhanced learning objectives to reflect expanded content
Updated marketing copy for community positioning

**Bug Fixes**

Fixed Module 3 subsection display issues (CSS + JavaScript coordination)
Resolved blank content sections in Module 4
Fixed subsection "active" class application
Corrected navigation state management between modules
Improved console logging for debugging navigation issues


## [v2.4] - October 16, 2025
**Module 4 Restructure**

Expanded Module 4 from 3 to 5 subsections:

Core Principles (existing - enhanced)
Tools & CSP Shared Responsibility (NEW)
De-Identification (existing - preserved)
BAA & Obligations (enhanced with upstream obligations)
Data Architecture (NEW - isolation strategies)



**Question Bank Expansion**

Added ~10 new questions (from 40 to ~50 total)
Enhanced scenario-based questions for technical teams
Improved answer feedback with detailed explanations

**Terminology Updates**

Standardized on "CSP" (Cloud Service Provider) for vendor-agnostic content
Updated all cloud platform references to use CSP terminology
Maintained specific examples (AWS/GCP/Azure) while being brand-neutral
