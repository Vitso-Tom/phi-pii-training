## [v3.2] - October 21, 2025 (Current Version)
### Interactive Educational Tooltips

**Major UX Enhancement: Contextual Learning**

Added comprehensive hover tooltips to all Module 3 technical checklists, transforming them from "what to check" into "why it matters + how to do it + what happens if you don't."

#### New Interactive Tooltips Added to:

**1. Database Design Review Checklist (7 items)**
- Table separation strategies
- Foreign key implications
- Query pattern analysis
- ORM configuration risks
- Indexing strategy considerations
- Database logging exposures
- Backup strategy flexibility

**2. API Design Review Checklist (10 items)**
- Response structure implications
- Endpoint separation benefits
- Field selection patterns
- Authorization levels
- Rate limiting strategies
- Caching strategy risks
- Logging configuration
- Error response safety
- API documentation practices
- Versioning security

**3. Before Deploying to Production Checklist (8 items)**
- Audit log statements (with code examples)
- ORM/database logging risks
- APM configuration dangers
- Error tracking exposures
- BAA coverage requirements
- Log retention policies
- Access controls
- Log export risks

**4. Before Implementing Analytics/ML Features Checklist (8 items)**
- PII identification strategies
- Health context detection
- Correlation mapping
- Safe pattern choices (A/B/C options)
- BAA coverage for analytics platforms
- ML pipeline scrutiny
- Third-party tool auditing
- Decision documentation

**5. Before Building Any Integration Checklist (8 items)**
- Data inventory methodology
- Combination point identification
- Complete data flow mapping
- Comprehensive BAA coverage
- Integration logging risks

#### Tooltip Features:

- **Rich Educational Content**: Each tooltip provides 3-5 paragraphs of detailed explanation
- **Real-World Examples**: Specific code examples, scenarios, and gotchas
- **Actionable Guidance**: "How to fix," "What to do," "Questions to ask"
- **Consequence Awareness**: "What happens if you miss this," "Why this matters"
- **Visual Design**: Dark-themed tooltips with clear hierarchy and readability
- **Smart Positioning**: Tooltips appear below items without obscuring content
- **Hover Interaction**: Natural hover behavior with smooth transitions
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 41 total interactive tooltip items across 5 critical checklists

#### Educational Impact:

This update transforms static checklists into interactive learning tools. Instead of reading "Check ORM configuration" and wondering what that means, developers now hover and learn:
- What ORMs do by default (SELECT *)
- Why this is dangerous (pulls diagnosis codes when you only wanted email)
- How to fix it (configure explicit column selection)
- Real examples of good vs bad patterns

#### Technical Implementation:

- Pure CSS tooltips (no JavaScript required)
- Accessible with keyboard navigation
- Mobile-responsive width constraints
- Z-index management to prevent overlap
- Dotted underline visual indicator
- Help cursor on hover
- Smooth opacity transitions

#### File Hash:
**SHA-256**: `63A33B048455BD1AE0E00B79B70B7963EB5DF1C46A7FCB48708CBE60A1B454FD`

## [v3.0] - October 19, 2025
### Major Content Enhancements

#### Module 3 Complete Rewrite - "When Safe Data Becomes PHI"

Expanded from simple scenarios to 6 comprehensive subsections with advanced technical content
Added 20+ minutes of expert-level training content
New subsections:

1. Basic Context Rules (foundation)
2. Database Design & API Patterns (architectural decisions)
3. Logging & Analytics Traps (observability pitfalls)
4. The Inference Problem (behavioral patterns)
5. Multi-System Data Flows (integration points)
6. HIPAA Safe Harbor (technical implementation)

**Module 3 Subsection Details:**

- **Database & API Patterns**: Schema design anti-patterns, table join implications, API response design, GraphQL query risks, code examples with PostgreSQL/MySQL patterns
- **Logging & Analytics**: Error logs capturing PHI, stack traces, analytics events, monitoring tools (Datadog/CloudWatch/Azure Monitor), safe logging patterns with hashed IDs
- **Inference Problem**: Behavioral patterns implying health conditions, app usage timing, location + health app correlation, technical solutions (differential privacy, k-anonymity, aggregation thresholds)
- **Multi-System Flows**: CRM + EHR integration, marketing + health programs, support ticket PHI creation, time window effects, session correlation risks
- **Safe Harbor Implementation**: Technical database views, automated redaction, ZIP code population lookups, practical code examples

#### Module 4 Core Principles Expansion

Expanded "Core Principles" subsection with three foundational principles:

1. **Minimize Access & Storage** - Default deny, scope reduction, practical examples
2. **Use Approved Tools Only** - BAA requirements, tool vetting process, common violations
3. **De-identify for Development** - Synthetic data, transformation techniques, testing strategies

- Added "What this means in practice" sections for each principle
- Included common violation examples with real-world scenarios

- Practical guidance for AWS, GCP, Azure environments
- Enhanced learning objectives to reflect expanded content
- Updated marketing copy for community positioning

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed Module 3 subsection display issues (CSS + JavaScript coordination)
- Resolved blank content sections in Module 4
- Fixed subsection "active" class application
- Corrected navigation state management between modules
- Improved console logging for debugging navigation issues
